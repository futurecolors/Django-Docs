Django Docs (http://djangodocs.com) â€” fancy django documentation with live search.

Our favorite framework Django has excellent documentation (https://docs.djangoproject.com/),
but some aspects of it are not perfect, basically it concerns searching. If you want to find something,
it's easier to use Google. The main purpose of Django Docs is to provide user-friendly searching
on the Django documentation.

How are we going to achieve this goal:
- give an answer, not a set of results;
- do not hide the search results;
- improve formatting for a better reading of documentation;
- live search, suggesting search results in process of typing.
- search suggestions (in the nearest future);

The first version of the project is being developed in the Django Dash 2011 contest. We have only 48 hours
to resolve this ambitious task. If you find any bugs or you have any idea how to make django docs better,
please write us in https://github.com/futurecolors/Django-Docs/issues. You can also send Pull Requests,
we will be happy to add improvements suggested by the community.

By the way, we have already made useful jQuery cheatsheet: http://futurecolors.ru/jquery/
